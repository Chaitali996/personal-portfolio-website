Live project -https://portfolio-website-chaitali-ahire.netlify.app/

The contribution of this project is to provide a visually appealing and interactive website for showcasing the my projects and skills. By utilizing the latest technologies such as React hooks, modern CSS, and Swiper JS, the website provides an immersive experience for the user. The implementation of dark and light mode, along with smooth transitions, adds to the overall usability and aesthetic appeal of the website. The use of the Email JS library for contact purposes also makes it easier for potential employers or clients to reach out to me.
